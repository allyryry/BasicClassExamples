The F1 score seeks to balance PRECISION (avoid false positives) and RECALL (target true positives, at cost of false positives). There's also a way (fbeta) to adjust the balance between recall and precision, but we'll set that aside for now. The f1 score is:\n",

The idea is always the same - we want to find something that minimizes the amount of error. In a question on the credit card fraud I said that you may try to optimize for some other metric than raw accuracy - this is an example of one that is common. In short, you'll define a ML algorithm to use, then define a loss function (e.g. log-loss), and the algorithm will repeat trials (gradient descent) in an effort to minimize that \"loss\". \n",

E.g. if a value is true, and a prediction is .8 probability, the corrected probability is .8; if a value is false and the prediction is .8 probability, the corrected proability is .2. These values are \"logged\", then the negative average is taken (the logs are negative), and that's the metric for loss - or how bad the predictions are. Less loss, more accuracy. This is also known as cross-entropy loss. Think back to the original look we took at error in the first look at logistic regression. \n",

    "<h2>Feature Scaling</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature scaling includes several similar methods of taking numerical values and transforming them to be on a different scale. There are several, a few we'll look at right now are:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Normalization - rescale the data so all values are between 0 and 1. \n",
    "<li>Standardization - rescale the data so there is a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. \n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "These all process our data in a similar way - taking the original data, and shifting its distribution using a transformation. The calculations for these scaling methods are:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Normalization: x = ( (x-min(x)) / (max(x)-min(x)) )\n",
    "<li>Standardization: x = ( (x-mean(x)) / (std(x)) )\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: There are other feature scaling algorithms/methods, these are just the two more common ones. The idea is pretty much always the same. One other consdieration is how the scaling treats outliers, which we'll worry about more next semester. \n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>OK.... Why?</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature scaling has several benefits, the impact of these benefits varies widely depending on the exact original data, and the type of models you're using. The reasons are:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Scaling - different values may have widely different scales (e.g. if processing a loan, age and net worth will be very different). Scaling can sometimes cause problems with the relative impact of different ranges distorting calculations. Small values can be \"drowned out\" by larger values. \n",
    "<li>Range - similar to the scale problem, if data values are radically different, some calculations will become less accurate. This particularly can impact distance based calculations, like clustering. \n",
    "<li>Speed - with algorithms that use methods like gradient descent (like logistic regression), having values on different scales and ranges may cause the algorithm to take longer to converge on a solution, or potentially prevent it at all. \n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature scaling can improve predictive accuracy, sometimes dramatically. Scaling data is not super impactful in some calculations (linear regression, trees) and it can (can - not will) be very impactful in others (logistic regression, gradient descent, neural networks, PCA). In general, when we have an algorithm that is adjusting itself to try to find the most accurate solution (e.g. log. reg. with gradient descent), scaling the data helps and is pretty standard. When we get to things like neural networks later on, it is just part of the process. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will do this pretty often in machine learning applications, similar to encoding categorical varaibles it is kind of a preparatory step that we just do without thinking much about it because it makes things work (or work better).\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Which Scaler to Pick?</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "There is not generally a definitive answer to that, and the real answer is to try a few and observe the results in accuracy. We do have a few rules of thumb:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Normalization: distribution is unkonwn, things need to be 0 to 1. \n",
    "<li>Standardization: distributions are normal. \n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "For now deciding between the methods isn't a huge concern. If the features look normal, we'll try to standardize; if not, normalize. We can worry about some finer differences as they come up next semester. If in doubt, try each, check accuracy, choose the best. Outliers will impact each (think about why), so we probably want to deal with those prior to scaling. "

    "Note: We have relatively little data, so the swings for accuracy between trials can be pretty pronounced. The first time I ran this there was a big improvement in accuracy after removing stuff, other runs had a smaller difference. More data would make it more stable, repeating the trials would also. You could build a loop to repeat trials, we'll do it the sklearn way early next semester. "
